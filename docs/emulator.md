# The emulator

The emulator is a Mac program that runs the core of [core.md](core.md) on an installed show,
the folder that [show.md](show.md) describes. It is the Python package `emulator` at the
repository root and uses only the Python standard library. It loads the core as a shared
library, built from the same `core/src/*.cpp` the firmware compiles, and leaves every
decision about files, time and commands to it.

## Commands

Run from the repository root.

| Command | What it does | What it needs |
|---|---|---|
| `make -C core shared` | Builds `core/build/libodrig_core.dylib`, the library the emulator loads, from every `core/src/*.cpp` with the flags of `make -C core`. | Apple's command-line developer tools: `make` and `c++`. |
| `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/emulator -t .` | Builds the shared library and runs the suite of `tests/emulator/`. | The same, and Python 3.10 or later with no added package. |

The emulator never builds the library itself. The suite is every `test_*.py` file in
`tests/emulator/`, found by discovery; importing the test package runs `make -C core shared`
first, and when that fails no test runs and make's output is the failure. The suite needs
no hardware, no network connection and no browser.
