# Commands

The board and the emulator accept the same commands, handled by the same code. A command
exists only if something really uses it.

## Lines

A command is one line of text ending in a newline; a carriage return before the newline is
ignored. Words are separated by single spaces. A line is at most 2,048 characters.

Every command gets exactly one reply: a JSON object on one line of at most 1,024 bytes.

- Success: `{"ok":true}`, with more members for `status`, `space`, `list` and `upload`.
- Failure: `{"ok":false,"error":"<code>"}`, with one more member for `bad-file`.

## Commands

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `play <id>` | Plays the item with that id from [show.json](show.md), from its first frame. |
| `on` | Switches the LEDs on. |
| `off` | Switches the LEDs off: every LED is dark. Playback time keeps running. |
| `brightness <n>` | Sets brightness, 0 to 255. |
| `status` | Reports the current state. |
| `space` | Reports the free and the total storage and the number of animations. |
| `list`, `list <from>` | Lists the items of the show. |
| `remove <id>` | Removes an item from the show. |
| `upload begin <id> <file> <bytes>` | Opens an upload of an animation. |
| `upload data <offset> <base64>` | Adds a piece of the file to the open upload. |
| `upload end <crc32>` | Closes the upload and installs the animation. |
| `upload cancel` | Discards the open upload. |

At power-on the LEDs are on, brightness is the value in `show.json`, and the `start` item
is playing if there is one. What `play`, `on`, `off` and `brightness` change is not kept
across a restart. What `remove` and `upload` change is: they change the installed show.

Brightness scales every colour value v to `(v * brightness + 127) / 255`, rounded down.

A number in a command is written in decimal digits.

## Status reply

```json
{"ok":true,"on":true,"brightness":128,"playing":3,"animation":1,"fps":50,"error":null}
```

| Member | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `on` | Whether the LEDs are switched on. |
| `brightness` | Current brightness, 0 to 255. |
| `playing` | The id of the item being played, or `null`. |
| `animation` | The id of the animation item on the LEDs right now, or `null`. It differs from `playing` when a cycle is playing. |
| `fps` | LED refreshes in the last full second. |
| `error` | `null`, or the reason the show is invalid. |

## Storage and the installed items

```
space
{"ok":true,"free":8372224,"total":10354688,"animations":2}
```

`free` and `total` are bytes of the storage the show is in. `animations` is the number of
animation items of the show, and 0 while the show is invalid.

```
list
{"ok":true,"items":[{"id":1,"file":"hello.odrg","bytes":1138},{"id":2,"file":"dvd.odrg","bytes":1612},{"id":3,"cycle":[1,2],"seconds":15}],"next":null}
```

The items come in the order of `show.json`, beginning at the position `<from>`, counted
from 0, which is 0 when it is left out. `<from>` is 0 to 65,535. An animation item has its
`id`, its `file` and the size of that file in `bytes`. A cycle has its `id`, the ids of its
animations in `cycle`, and its `seconds`. The reply holds as many items as fit into it.
`next` is the position of the first item that was left out, to be asked for with
`list <next>`, or `null` when the last item is in the reply. A position at or after the end
gives no items and `null`, and so does a show without items:
`{"ok":true,"items":[],"next":null}`. While the show is invalid, `list` is refused with
`show-invalid`. A cycle too long to fit into a reply by itself is listed with
`"cycle":[]`.

## Removing an item

```
remove 2
{"ok":true}
```

The item leaves the show, and the items after it move up.

- An animation that a cycle lists is refused with `in-use`: remove the cycle first.
- If the item is the `start` item, the show has no `start` afterwards.
- If the item is playing, playback stops and the LEDs go dark. Anything else that plays
  goes on undisturbed.
- The animation's file is deleted when no remaining item names it.
- While an upload is open, `remove` is refused with `busy`.

## Uploading an animation

An animation is sent as an ODRG file, in pieces, each acknowledged:

```
upload begin 4 clip.odrg 3200
{"ok":true,"chunk":1500}
upload data 0 T0RSRwEB...
{"ok":true,"received":1500}
upload data 1500 ...
{"ok":true,"received":3000}
upload data 3000 ...
{"ok":true,"received":3200}
upload end 1c291ca3
{"ok":true}
```

**`upload begin <id> <file> <bytes>`** opens an upload. One upload can be open at a time,
whichever route its commands arrive by.

- `<id>` is 1 to 65,535. An id that no item has makes a new item, which becomes the last
  of the show. The id of an animation item replaces that item's animation; the item keeps
  its id and its position. A client that wants a new item chooses any id that `list` does
  not show.
- `<file>` is the name the file gets, under the naming rule of [show.md](show.md).
- `<bytes>` is the size of the file, 1 to 4,294,967,295.
- The reply's `chunk` is the most bytes one `upload data` line may carry.
- It is refused with `busy` when an upload is open; with `in-use` when the id belongs to
  a cycle, or another item already names `<file>`; and with `no-space` when the file
  would not fit into the free storage, or the show has no room for another item.

**`upload data <offset> <base64>`** adds bytes. `<offset>` is the number of bytes sent
before these, and must equal the number received so far; otherwise the reply is
`bad-offset` and the bytes are not taken. `<base64>` is 1 to `chunk` bytes in base64 with
the alphabet `A`-`Z`, `a`-`z`, `0`-`9`, `-` and `_` (RFC 4648, section 5), without `=` at
the end. The reply's `received` is the number of bytes received so far. Bytes beyond the
size given to `upload begin` are refused with `bad-offset`.

**`upload end <crc32>`** closes the upload. `<crc32>` is the CRC-32 of the whole file as
eight hexadecimal digits, `0`-`9` and `a`-`f`: the CRC-32 of zlib and PNG, which for the
nine bytes `123456789` is `cbf43926`.

- `incomplete`: fewer bytes arrived than `upload begin` named. The upload stays open.
- `bad-checksum`: the bytes received have another CRC-32. The upload is discarded.
- `busy`: the file is still being checked. The upload stays open; send `upload end`
  again. The check decodes the whole file while the show goes on playing, one frame of
  the file for each LED refresh, so it takes about as long as a fiftieth of a second for
  each frame of the animation.
- `bad-file`: the file is not a valid ODRG file for the canvas. The reply has one more
  member, `{"ok":false,"error":"bad-file","reason":"<reason>"}`: a reason of "ODRG files"
  in [reasons.md](reasons.md), or `size-mismatch` when the file is for another canvas
  size. The upload is discarded.
- On success the file is in place and the item is in the show. It can be played at once.
  If the item that is playing got a new animation, or a cycle that is playing lists it,
  what is playing starts again from its first frame.

**`upload cancel`** discards the open upload. An upload on which nothing has moved for 60
seconds is discarded too: no data arrived, and no check is running.

Playback goes on during an upload. Nothing of the show changes before `upload end`
succeeds.

## Error codes

| Code | When |
|---|---|
| `line-too-long` | The line is longer than 2,048 characters. |
| `unknown-command` | The first word is not a command. |
| `bad-argument` | An argument is missing, extra, not a number, out of range, or not in its form: a file name outside the naming rule, base64 that is not as described or stands for more bytes than `chunk`, a CRC-32 that is not eight hexadecimal digits, or a word after `upload` that is not `begin`, `data`, `end` or `cancel`. |
| `show-invalid` | `play`, `list`, `remove` or an `upload` command was sent while the show is invalid. |
| `no-upload` | `upload data`, `upload end` or `upload cancel` was sent while no upload is open. |
| `incomplete` | `upload end` came before all bytes. |
| `bad-checksum` | `upload end` names another CRC-32 than the bytes received have. |
| `busy` | `upload begin` or `remove` while an upload is open; `upload end` while the file is being checked. |
| `unknown-id` | `play` or `remove` names an id that is not in `show.json`. |
| `in-use` | `remove` names an animation that a cycle lists; `upload begin` names the id of a cycle, or a file name another item has. |
| `no-space` | `upload begin`: the file would not fit, or the show has no room for another item. |
| `bad-offset` | `upload data`: the offset is not the number of bytes received so far, or the bytes would pass the size of the file. |
| `bad-file` | `upload end`: the file is not a valid ODRG file for the canvas. |
| `storage-error` | The storage could not be read or written. The show is as it was. An upload that met it is discarded. |

When more than one code applies, the reply has the first in the order of this table.

## Transports

A transport only carries lines to the command front-end and replies back. The commands and
replies are the same on every transport.

| Where | Serial | Network |
|---|---|---|
| Board | The USB serial port. | HTTP over Wi-Fi, on the board's web server. |
| Emulator | A virtual serial port on the Mac. | HTTP on the emulator's page address. |

**HTTP.** A command is sent as `POST /odrig` with the command line as the request body, with
or without the final newline. The response body is the reply line, with content type
`application/json`. The response status is 200 whenever the line reached the command
front-end, including replies with `"ok":false`. Any other method on `/odrig` gets status 405.
